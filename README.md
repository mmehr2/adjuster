# adjuster
Simple binary search with hardware interface (from interview)

Plan:
1. Save Adjuster.cpp in Github repo w. readme
1. Get it to compile (VSCode via CL *or* VS2019)
1. Copy over to an (empty) C# file and repo
1. Convert the code over into proper C# interfaces and classes
1. Implement NUNIT tests on the C# side
1. Get those tests to compile and run
1. Get to GREEN!
1. Ideas for refactoring...let them appear!

- MILESTONE: C++ running
- MILESTONE: AC# running
- MILESTONE: AC# tests running
